For quite some time now, Iâ€™ve been wanting to create a space where I could share what Iâ€™ve learnedâ€”not just from the frontend world, but from software engineering as a whole. After gathering countless insights from different projects, I finally decided to make the leap and start this blog.

This will be a place to document my findings, snippets, and any interesting details I come across while building software. Whether itâ€™s a clever frontend trick, a backend solution, or just a useful tip Iâ€™ve picked up, Iâ€™ll be sharing it all here. My hope is that this blog becomes a helpful resource for fellow developers like you, as well as a reference point for my future self.

## What Youâ€™ll Find Here

This blog will primarily feature snippets and findings from my journey through software engineering. Whether itâ€™s something Iâ€™ve learned on the frontend, an interesting detail from the backend, or a new technique Iâ€™ve discovered while working on current projects, itâ€™ll all be documented here.

The content might range from quick snippets of code that solve a specific problem, to more in-depth explorations of challenges Iâ€™ve faced in my day-to-day work. My aim is to keep things practical and useful for anyone who stumbles upon these topics while searching for solutions or inspiration.

## Behind the Scenes: The Tech Stack

This blog is powered by a combination of [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), you can check the source code [here](https://github.com/quinsberry/quinsberry.github.io).

As I continue building out this blog, Iâ€™ll be sure to document any helpful tips or workflows I come across, so stay tuned for more posts on how everything works behind the scenes.
